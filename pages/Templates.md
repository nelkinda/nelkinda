# Templates

We regularly start greenfield projects for various reasons:
- Bootcamps and training
- PoCs
- Client projects

Doing so, we have come to value having templates to kickstart projects.

We urrently have the following templates:
- [Gradle, Java, single-module](https://github.com/nelkinda/template-java-gradle)
- [Gradle, Kotlin, single-module](https://github.com/nelkinda/template-kotlin-gradle)
- [Gradle, Java, multi-module](https://github.com/nelkinda/template-java-multi-gradle)
- [Gradle, Kotlin, multi-module](https://github.com/nelkinda/template-kotlin-multi-gradle)
