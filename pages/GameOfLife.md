# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton.
It is a popular challenge for coderetreats, and a popular task to give to computer science students.

Nelkinda provides a solution to Game of Life with the following criteria:
- virtually infinite universe (`Set<Point>` instead of `bool[][]`)
- rules as strategy pattern
- parts fully tested using unit tests (TDD)
- application fully tested using acceptance tests (BDD)
- 100% code coverage
- Java: 100% mutation coverage (mutation testing)
